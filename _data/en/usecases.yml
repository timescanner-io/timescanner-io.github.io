      A fixed-price service is nothing more than a time-based service. Except you have to estimate the time you will spend.
      <br><br>
      If the estimate is good, the project can be very profitable. But if not, you risk losing a lot of money.
      <br><br>
      Having reliable data on similar past projects will allow you to make accurate estimates.
