  title: A radically different method
  description: |
    Traditional Time Tracking tools all require you to start and stop a timer. Tedious, right?
    <br><br>
    With Timescanner, no new tool, no new habit. Simply name your calendar events using the following format, and your work times will be calculated automatically.
  conclusion: Timescanner isn't just a Time Tracker. It's an organizational method designed to make you more efficient.

event:
  client_name: Client Name
  project_name: Project Name
  event_title: Your event title
  event_time: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM

rentability:
  title: Increase your business revenue

    Estimating the time needed for a fixed-price project directly impacts your profitability. If you make a mistake on the quote, your margin disappears.
    <br><br>
    Timescanner allows you to analyze your past similar projects to give you a reliable estimate of the time required.

time_tracking:
  title: Stop wasting time tracking it
  description: |
    As a freelancer, <b>every minute not spent on a client is a financial loss</b>, because you don't bill for it.
    <br><br>
    Yet, traditional Time Tracking tools force you to juggle a timer and re-enter all information manually. Even though you've already recorded it in your calendar.
    <br><br>
    <b>The result? You waste time... tracking it.</b>

efficiency:
  title: Become more efficient and productive
  description: |
    The most productive CEOs already use this approach: <b>everything goes through their calendar</b>. They are organized down to the quarter-hour to manage their businesses.
    <br><br>
    <i>The only difference between them and you? They have an assistant to manage their calendar for them.</i>
    <br><br>
    By adopting the <b>calendar reflex</b>, you structure your time, avoid forgetting things, and simplify your management.

  revenue:
    title: Estimate your end-of-month revenue
    description: |
      Organizing your calendar with recurring events for your clients allows you to predict your end-of-month revenue from the beginning of the month. 
      <br><br>
      <b>It's up to you to decide whether to work or rest.</b>
  reporting:
    title: Easily generate your Activity Reports
    description: |
      The events in your calendar provide enough information about your activity to generate a monthly report for you to send to your clients.
      <br><br>
      <b>Stop wasting time on reporting.</b>

database:
  title: Calendars As A Database
  description: |
    Timescanner calculates work times in real-time, directly from your calendar. We don't save anything in a database. Disabling your calendar or changing the duration of an event will therefore have an immediate impact. 
    
    <br><br>

    Your calendar <b>IS</b> the database. <b>Your events remain confidential.</b>
  conclusion: Your data stays on your calendar. We don't have access to it.
