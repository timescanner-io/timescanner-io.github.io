  text: "

  "

    Timescanner allows you to analyze your past similar projects to give you a reliable estimate of the time needed.
    <br><br>
    <b>To increase your profitability, stop making assumptions. Base your decisions on concrete data.</b>

time_tracking:
  title: Stop wasting time tracking time
  description: "
    As a freelancer, <strong>every minute not spent on a client is a financial loss</strong> because you can't bill it.
    <br><br>
    Yet traditional time tracking tools force you to juggle with a timer and manually re-enter all information. Even though you've already recorded it in your calendar.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Result? You waste time... tracking time.</strong>

    The most productive CEOs already use this approach: <strong>everything goes through their calendar</strong>. They are organized down to the quarter hour to manage their business.
    <br><br>
    <i>The only difference between them and you? They have an assistant to manage their calendar for them.</i>
    <br><br>
    By adopting the <strong>calendar reflex</strong>, you structure your time, avoid forgetfulness, and simplify your management.

database:
  title: Calendars As A Database
  description: "
    Timescanner calculates working time in real-time, directly from your calendar. We don't store anything in a database. Disabling your calendar or changing an event's duration will have an immediate impact.
    
    <br><br>

    Your calendar <strong>IS</strong> the database. <strong>Your events remain confidential.</strong>
